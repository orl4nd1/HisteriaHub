# Histeria Hub Core ðŸ›Ž

HisteriaHub consists of everything you need for your lobby server, it is not functional on servers that consist of only one, a bungeecord is necessary and it is compatible with EzQueue (grateful to a client for letting me use the plugin API through a purchase made by the same) and PlaceholderAPI.

It also depends on Vault and is developed in version 1.7.10 - 1.8.8


Extremely old plugin, added to my github for my clients to see as development, may have bugs, functions, variables or programming methods that I don't use, but it's better to have a base for them to see than nothing.
